Conclusion
In this project, I explored the relationship between GDP and Life Expectancy across multiple countries using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Key Learnings
Learned how to prepare and clean data for analysis (handling column names, missing values, and summary checks).
Applied visualization techniques (line plots, scatter plots, regression lines) to uncover country-wise and overall trends.
Used correlation analysis to measure the statistical relationship between GDP and life expectancy.

Results vs. Expectations
It was expected that wealthier nations (higher GDP) would have higher life expectancy, which the data partially confirmed.
The correlation value (~0.34) showed a moderate positive relationship, not as strong as anticipated. This indicates that while GDP plays a role, it is not the sole determinant of life expectancy.

Key Findings
Moderate positive correlation between GDP and life expectancy: Higher GDP generally corresponds with higher life expectancy, but exceptions exist.
Country-specific variations: Some nations maintain relatively high life expectancy despite lower GDP, likely due to effective healthcare systems and social policies.
Time trends: Most countries show improvements in life expectancy over time, though the pace of GDP growth varies significantly.

Takeaways
GDP is a useful proxy for development, but it is not the only driver of health outcomes.
Factors such as healthcare quality, education, nutrition, and inequality significantly influence life expectancy beyond economic wealth.
A holistic approach is needed to understand and improve public health outcomes, not just economic growth.
